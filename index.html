        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>In my past life I was a part time freelance designer who dabbled in web design. After being out of that world for a while I decided I missed it. So I've opted to jump back in and learn all the fancy new gears and widgets in the web design/development world today. </p>
        <p>I’ve had several interesting jobs throughout life, Funeral Home Operator, Furniture Delivery Guy, Youth Worker and currently a purchaser at an Air Filter Company as well as teaching martial arts. That along with having an amazing wife and kids makes everyday a learning experience. </p>
